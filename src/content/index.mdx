# 👋 Welcome to cliref.dev

> A simple, fast, and open-source reference site for your favorite command-line tools.

---

We built **cliref.dev** because developers deserve better than endless Stack Overflow rabbit holes or bloated blog posts just to remember how to do a `git rebase`.

Here you'll find clean, categorized CLI docs — no ads, no popups, just helpful commands when you need them.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

Think of **cliref** as your personal terminal cheat sheet — but shared with the world.

- ✅ Handy examples for tools like `git`, `docker`, `ssh`, and more  
- 🔍 Fast, searchable, and easy to extend  
- 🧱 Powered by Markdown + MDX  
- 🌐 Subdomain-based routing (like `git.cliref.dev`)  
- 💖 Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Nextra](https://nextra.site), and a lot of care
